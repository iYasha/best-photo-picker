// MARK: - Score JSON contract (ADR 0008)
//
// The Python core's `bestphoto score --json` output is the app's contract.
// Two payloads cross the boundary:
//
//   1. A stream of `ScoreProgress` events — one compact JSON object **per line**
//      (JSON-lines / NDJSON) emitted while the pass runs, so the Scoring screen
//      can animate live.
//   2. A single `ScoreResult` document — the final result, emitted once the pass
//      completes.
//
// JSON key convention: the wire format is **snake_case**; the Swift types are
// camelCase. Decoding is done with `JSONDecoder.keyDecodingStrategy =
// .convertFromSnakeCase` (see `ScoreContract.decoder` / `ScoreContract.lineDecoder`),
// so there are **no per-field `CodingKeys`** — add a field here and matching
// snake_case key on the wire and it maps automatically. The one place this
// matters: enum *raw values* are NOT touched by the key strategy, so the
// `String` raw values below must match the wire spelling exactly (all lowercase).
//
// These types are `Decodable` only. Marks are read-only AI suggestions
// (ADR 0006); the app never encodes them back. The human's Favourite/selection
// is app-side state, deliberately absent from this input contract.

// MARK: Progress event

/// Elapsed / remaining time are **derived client-side** by `CoreBridge` from the
/// wall clock and the `done / total` ratio — the core does not carry them, so the
/// estimate stays honest to the machine actually running the pass. Only the raw
/// counts and the currently-processing frame travel on the wire.
